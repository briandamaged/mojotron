MOJOTRON: ROBOT WARS
https://identicalsoftware.com/mojotron

Current Developer: dulsi@identicalsoftware.com

Original Author: craigtimpany@w3.to

Installation (Source)
=====================
To compile mojotron you'll need SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and expat
installed with headers.

Compilation on Linux should just be a case of unpacking the source tarball
and typing 'make'.

For Windows, there is a Makefile_mingw which will compile it under the mingw
crosscompiler. You can build it directly under Windows but you will need to
modify the makefiles to do so.


Installation (Binaries)
======================
Binaries are available at https://dulsi.itch.io/mojotron-robot-wars for
Windows and Linux. Unzip the zip archive. Run mojotron.


Status
======
The Mojotron: Robot Wars conversion is not complete. Ideas and patches are very
welcome.


Command-line options

Gameplay
========
The game is a descendant of the arcade classic Robotron, with many
enhancements. Kill all the monsters on the screen to advance a level.

Controls
========
Like Robotron, movement is independant of which direction you're firing in. 
If you're not using twin joysticks like in the arcades you can aim using the
cursor keys, and use the following to move around: 
W - aim up
A - aim left
S - aim down
D - aim right

This is just the same shape as the cursor keys, except shifted to the top left
of the keyboard (a convention from the First Person Shooter genre). Firing is 
automatic.

The other important key is the spacebar. Use this to activate any of the
diamond shaped powerups you collect.

You can pause the game by pressing 'p'.

Bonuses
=======
Each level has a time limit, if you don't finish it in time that's OK, but if
you do, you'll skip 3 levels and get an extra life. 

As you travel through the game, you'll find lots of fruit scattered through the
levels. If you take 3 of a kind, 3 of the same colour, or 3 with colours in
the order of a rainbow, you'll receive powerups and extra lives.

Just some of the powerups in the game:

Flamethrower
(Very good for killing large enemies, but doesn't have much range)

Machine Gun
(Does a lot of damage but isn't very accurate)

Shrinker
(Shrinks everything on the screen. Good for getting out of cramped places)

Extra Time
(Gives you 5 extra seconds of warp time)

Teleport
(Puts you in a random position, hopefully away from danger)

Bomb
(Powerful explosion in the direction that you're firing)

Instacrate
(Surrounds you with a barricade of 8 pushable crates)

Ram Droid
(Covers you in the direction you're firing, and can be used to squish monsters)
